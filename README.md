# COTS
This site focuses on the COTS map, as described in the TOG-ACM forthcoming paper:
   "Corner-Operated Tran-Similar Maps, Patterns, and Lattices" by Jarek Rossignac,
and on its applictions and extensions.
The code provided is an interacive Sketch for a self-guided demo of the COTS behavior and possibilities.
If you do not have Processing installed, please download the latest version from:
https://processing.org/download/
Download and open the sketch, then run it.
Precise instructions for the above and for running the demo are provided in the PDF:
GUIDE FOR USING THE COTS SKETCH.pdf
The sketch provided here was tested with Processing version 3.5.3, but I expect that it will run on other recent and future versions.
